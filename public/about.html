<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a new Web Developer with a background in Automotive repair and
  Manufacturing.
</p>

<p>
  Some of my hobbies are building custom computers and 3D printing. While I
  built my first computer in 1999, I only recently started 3D printing.

  When I am not messing with hardware or software, I am spending time with my
  wife and daughter. We love shopping, riding bikes/scooters around the
  neighborhood, and going to local arcades.
